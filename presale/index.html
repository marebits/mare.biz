					<ol>
						<li>By participating in this presale, you agree to the following terms</li>
						<li>
							The <a href="//github.com/marebits/marebits-presale" rel="external noopener" target="_blank">smart contract source code is available on Github</a> and will be verified on Etherscan as soon as feasibly possible.  The following are dictated by the smart contract and <strong>are immutable</strong>:
							<ol>
								<li>1 MARE will cost <data value="0.000000000016460018942686562615386538246561">0.0000000000165 ETH</data>; or for each 1 ETH you will receive <data value="60753271517">60,753,271,517 MARE</data></li>
								<li>The pre-sale has a set start time and a set end time; <strong>no sales will be allowed outside of this period</strong></li>
								<li>The pre-sale is <strong>limited to 2 ETH</strong> (<data value="121506543034">121,506,543,034 MARE</data>); no sales will be allowed once this limit is reached and no sale will be allowed that would exceed this limit, but the sale will not be considered ended until the end time has passed</li>
								<li>The pre-sale smart contract owner is able to <em>finalize</em> the sale early; if this happens, then no further sales will be allowed, but the sale will not be considered ended until the end time has passed</li>
								<li>Once the pre-sale has ended (but not necessarily finalized), you will be able to withdraw your purchased MARE; <strong>this will only happen after the end time has passed</strong></li>
								<li>
									Once the pre-sale is ended, the smart contract owner will finalize it.  Doing so will:
									<ol>
										<li>Return all unsold MARE to the pre-sale smart contract owner</li>
										<li>Transfer all ETH raised to the pre-sale smart contract owner</li>
									</ol>
									This finalization step is <em>not necessary</em> for your purchased MARE to be withdrawn
								</li>
							</ol>
						</li>
						<li>
							The sole purpose of this pre-sale is to allow the community to provide the liquidity needed for long-term exchange smart contracts.  To accomplish this:
							<ol>
								<li>All ETH raised and all unsold MARE will be combined into liquidity smart contracts on select Ethereum and Matic <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_exchange" rel="external noopener" target="_blank">decentralized exchanges</a>, in an as yet to be determined split (open to input on this, probably a mix of <a href="//app.1inch.io/" rel="external noopener" target="_blank">1inch</a>, <a href="//app.uniswap.org/" rel="external noopener" target="_blank">Uniswap</a>, <a href="//app.sushi.com/" rel="external noopener" target="_blank">SushiSwap</a>, <a href="//quickswap.exchange/" rel="external noopener" target="_blank">QuickSwap</a>, and/or any others suggested)</li>
								<li>The liquidity smart contracts will be configured so that the initial rate for 1 MARE on the exchanges will be valued at approximately <data value="0.000000000021398024625633416156272099549501">0.0000000000214 ETH</data>; or 1 ETH for <data value="46733285782">46,733,285,782 MARE</data> (meaning you get approximately <data value="0.30000000000855920985025336646251">30%</data> more MARE per ETH during the pre-sale)</li>
								<li>Each of these liquidity contracts will be <strong>locked for at least 5 years</strong></li>
								<li>If necessary in order to maintain the desired rate, we will either provide ETH funding directly from a private account or <strong>we will burn any excess MARE</strong>.  If a burn is done, it will be posted here publicly (this could happen if there is too much MARE to list on the exchanges and not enough ETH)</li>
								<li>In the event of an excess of ETH raised by the pre-sale (very unlikely if my math is right), it will be sold off and the proceeds <strong>donated to a horse-related charity</strong> with which we are unaffiliated (this could happen if there is too much ETH for the remaining MARE to be listed on the exchanges)</li>
								<li>In other words, <em>we will be taking 0 profit at the end of this pre-sale</em></li>
							</ol>
						</li>
						<li><strong>MARE is not an investment vehicle</strong>, there is <em>nothing</em> backing MARE, it is an extremely risky meme coin and its value could fall at any time</li>
						<li>There are <strong>no guarantees</strong> that the price of your MARE will increase or decrease</li>
						<li>The above being understood, <strong>we do personally vow to abide by these terms as closely as possible</strong> and will provide evidence on the site of all contracts and transactions relating to liquidity, burns, donations, and locking of assets.  Please contact us at one of the links above and ask if you think there is some documentation we are missing</li>
						<li>Please note, since exchanges are volatile, there is <em class="super-important">no guarantee</em> your MARE will retain its value</li>
						<li><em class="super-important">MARE is not an investment vehicle, there is no company backing MARE</em></li>
						<li>As a meme token, MARE is <em>extremely risky</em> and there is <strong>no guarantee it will hold value</strong>, so please don't invest any money in MARE that you aren't willing to lose</li>
						<li>Many of the terms of this pre-sale are being governed by an Ethereum smart contract.  Please <strong><a href="//ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/smart-contracts/" rel="external noopener" target="_blank">know what this means</a></strong> and please <a href="//github.com/marebits/marebits-presale" rel="external noopener" target="_blank">examine that smart contract's source code carefully</a> and verify you understand all of the terms before making a purchase</li>
						<li>While we have made every effort to ensure the smart contract is safe, we will not be held liable in the case a flaw which we were not aware of occurs.  If possible, we will do what is necessary to make it right, but <strong>there is never a guarantee</strong></li>
						<li><em>Please know what you are doing</em> before you participate in this pre-sale; it is not for newbies!</li>
						<li><strong>You will have to perform two transactions to purchase MARE under this pre-sale</strong>: One for the purchase and one for the withdraw after the pre-sale has ended.  Each of these transactions will carry with it a network fee, and you are solely responsible for paying these fees.  These fees go to the Ethereum network and are not retained by us</li>
						<li>If you are at all unsure, please don't participate, and instead wait for the exchange listings, or ask a friend who is more knowledgeable to help you out; or, if you know who we are, come to us directly and we will lend a hoof</li>
						<li>In order for this presale to work, you <em class="super-important">must enable JavaScript</em> and it is highly recommended you use a <a href="//metamask.io/" rel="external noopener" target="_blank">MetaMask wallet</a> on an up-to-date version of either a <a href="//www.chromium.org/getting-involved/download-chromium" rel="external noopener" target="_blank">Chromium</a> (including <a href="//www.google.com/chrome/" rel="external noopener" target="_blank">Google Chrome</a>) or <a href="//www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/" rel="external noopener" target="_blank">Firefox</a> browser</li>
